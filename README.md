## [What is Smoke?](#what-is-smoke)
Smoke is a video game launcher designed to enhance user experience by integrating various aspects of gaming into one application. The gaming ecosystem is highly fragmented, leading to multiple launchers and complex management, especially for those involved in emulation, modding, or other gaming subspaces. Smoke aims to unify these elements, offering compatibility with a wide range of launchers, gaming services, and third-party tools. Our vision is to consolidate the best aspects of gaming under one roof, enriched with custom features. Currently, Smoke is not open-source; however, its modular design allows for extensive third-party add-on customization, potentially paving the way for future open-source development.

## [Feature Set](#feature-set)
### [Basic Launcher Features](#basic-launcher-features)
Smoke is envisioned to incorporate all standard features of video game launchers like Steam, Epic Games, and GOG Galaxy. We are committed to integrating with other services to minimize ecosystem fragmentation. Expect interoperable features such as friend lists and messaging. Smoke will scan and support games from various sources, including Steam, GOG, manual additions, and potentially the Smoke store. The launcher will also facilitate the installation of necessary applications in the background, enhancing user convenience. Smoke's cross-platform availability will include Windows, Linux, Android, and macOS, with functionality as a primary OS homescreen.

### [Emulators](#emulators)
While not just an emulator frontend, Smoke will be equipped with necessary features for emulation. It will seamlessly integrate, preconfigure, and silently install popular emulators when attempting to run a ROM. Users can add custom emulators, scan for ROMs, and scrape online metadata, with all customizable via add-ons. Smoke aims to unify your gaming library, providing equal features for emulated and native games. Emulators will be pre-set with higher render scales and modern options to appeal to contemporary gamers, without losing the retro charm.

### [Modding](#modding)
Inspired by the Steam Workshop, Smoke aims to provide a similar modding experience for all moddable games. Game pages will feature a modding section for easy mod installation and management, including automatic game files local backups. Future plans include a platform for modders to submit and showcase their creations, complete with social features like likes and comments. Smoke will also support modding for emulated games, integrating with online mod libraries and allowing for custom library integrations. Recognizing the importance of community contributions, mods and add-ons will feature dedicated pages highlighting their authors and donation options.

### [Social Features](#social-features)
Smoke will feature a unique social component, where each game has its own mini feed and forum. We're aiming to integrate with existing services for content richness, specifically looking into platforms like Reddit. However, if integration isn't feasible, we'll develop our own forums, focusing on user engagement and relevant content. After Reddit's recent events, we're also considering peer-to-peer forum technologies for stability and independence. Furthermore, an SDK will be provided in the future for games and mods to integrate with Smoke's social features, including a lightweight multiplayer system to add multiplayer capabilities to games without them. This will be complemented by community votes to select the recommended multiplayer mods for these games, creating a more connected and interactive gaming environment.

### [Speedrun & Competition](#speedrun--competition)
Game pages will serve as hubs for news, updates, guides, and live content. For speedrunning, we'll integrate with speedrun.com, providing access to popular runs, world records, and personal statistics, complete with a built-in chronometer overlay. For esports, we'll offer up-to-date information on games, teams, and amateur tournaments, along with integrations for displaying ranked statistics similar to services like op.gg.

### [Controllers](#controllers)
Designed for cross-platform use, Smoke's interface will be fully controller-compatible, offering utilities for key remapping and sharing configurations online.

### [Cloud Gaming](#cloud-gaming)
Smoke will not directly offer cloud gaming, but it will facilitate connections with services like GeForce Now or Xbox Cloud, enabling gameplay on low-end devices through account linking and automated setup processes.

### [Smoke Store](#smoke-store)
The Smoke store will offer comprehensive game purchasing options, aggregating data from various platforms to present the best and most economical purchasing methods. Transparency and user information are key, with plans to feature public domain games and support direct developer donations. Long-term goals include our own game publishing system and a secondary market, aiming to offer fairer conditions in these areas.

### [Customization & Addons](#customization--addons)
Smoke will allow feature deactivation for simplified use and support extensive add-on customization for functionality (excluding interface design, for now). Developers can create modules to enhance or add new functionalities. An in-game overlay, similar to Steam's, will display dynamic game information based on game compatibility with Smoke's local server.

### [Smoke Mindset](#smoke-mindset)
Smoke is being developed with an emphasis on user experience. We are confident that dedicating our efforts towards crafting an exceptional product will naturally yield positive outcomes. Our approach is to foster progress in the industry by dismantling barriers between platforms and ecosystems, thereby uniting players. While Smoke is not open-source at present, it's built predominantly with open-source technologies. We hope for Smoke to transition to open-source in the future, although confirming this is premature at this stage. We are dedicated to crafting a long-lasting application, ideally designed to operate without reliance on a central server. For this purpose, we are exploring a variety of peer-to-peer and distributed communication systems like IPFS and libp2p. Current limitations prevent running such an app entirely on peer-to-peer services, but we are optimistic about the potential for this to become viable in the future.
